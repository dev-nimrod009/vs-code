    Am glad to be born in the reign of His excellency honourable Emilio Mwai Kibaki as the president of Kenya.i grew up as other children
    but in great favour of the Lord an men.
</p>
<h2>educational background</h2>
<p>
I never wanted this but i schooled in different schools ie.two primary schools and three highschools.If i was asked i would say Mwangaza primark
 was one among the best primary schools i ever attended back then.Thouh rukira primary gave me the tate  to experience my childhood era ,I wouldn't
 rate it that high as Mwangaza primark.<br>
 Matters high school, I joined Christ The King KIrwaara High School the year 2018.2019 I transfered to Muruka High School and joined their current form two
 until i sat for my kcse .Even if i failed the school rewardd me on great front though my academics perfomance used to drop terribly but that a story
  for another day.In that school i was able to vist parliament and also being rewarded on all prize giving days.I attended two contest ,failed one but toped on the other one
  .That's where i started beleiving in myself and knowing under all circumstances i can make it.<br>
  Due to the poor perfomance in muruka high school in my kcse i decided to redo my kcse in Ichagaki Boys .Can't really say oit is karma or what but durning the second term i 
  perfomed greatly and i was rewarded with an air trip to Eldoret.I would wish to come back and narrate about that trip someday.SUming it up  that years kcse i scooped my B with over 54 points
  an additional of about 10 points from my previous kcse sitting.
